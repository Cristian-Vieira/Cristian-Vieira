## About Me
I'm Cristian Vieira, I from Brazil, starting a career in WEB Front-end programming, always looking to improve my knowledge. I'm currently studying Systems Analysis and Development at FATEC Ourinhos (University of Technology of Ourinhos-SP) and improving my JS skills. I have an interest in JavaScript (JS), TypeScript (TS), Node.js, React, Vue, Python (Py), and HTML/CSS for web development.

## What I'm Currently Doing
I'm currently dedicated to expanding my skill set in JavaScript. I believe that continuous learning is essential in the fast-paced world of web development, and I'm always looking for opportunities to enhance my knowledge and stay up to date with the latest technologies.
